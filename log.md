# Learning Log

## 2022-12-13 The Journey Begins

### Hosting
- had previously purchased a web domain (cyrusolinger.com) but never used it
- figured out how to transfer it from namecheap to bluehost for better webhosting options

### Code Editor
- installed VS Code
- installed live server extension, feels easier/faster?

### Version Control
- learned about git and GitHub
- learned basic commands: clone, push, add, commit, status, log

### HTML
- learned some basic tags: paragraphs, headings, bold text, italicized text, comments, ordered and unordered lists, links, images

### cyrusolinger.com
- added an unordered list of random facts about me
- added an ordered list of basketball greats
- added an image (relative link) of Alex Honnold with an alt and caption
- added a link to another page within my directly (./pages/about.html)

### Notes
- figured out how to point nameservers with namecheap hosting for dreamhoops.com
- published the site successfully
- learned how to use FTP via FileZilla (concerned about security?)
- got stuck trying to use GitHub as a source for my personal site as opposed to the cPanel File Manager or FTP

### Project
- created first project
- basic recipe website with link to a recipe

### CSS
- basic ways to select HTML items
- combinators and chaining of selectors
- IDs vs Classes
- font and color options
- height and width
- the cascade: what determines which rules actually get applied to our HTML
- external vs internal vs inline CSS
- box model
 - padding increases the space between the edge of a box and the content inside of it.
 - margin increases the space between a box and any others that sit next to it.
 - border adds space (even if itâ€™s only a pixel or two) between the margin and the padding.
- box-sizing: border-box is the alternative but common choice among devs.
- divs and spans

### "Flow"
- block vs inline vs inline-block
 - block: elements will appear on the page stacked atop each other
 - inline: appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside
 - inline-block: behave like inline elements, but with block-style padding and margin

### Inspector
- opening the Chrome inspector
- selecting page elements
- changing styles (temporarily) in real time

### Flexbox
- used for positoning
- flex container is defined by having "display: flex"
- flex item lives in the flex container
- nesting can occur and an element can be bother a container and an item
- "flex" declation is shorthand for three properties
 - flex-grow
 - flex-shrink
 - flex-basis
- axes
 - flex-direction: row/column
- alignment
 - justify-content aligns items across the main axis
 - align-items aligns items across the cross axis
- IMPORTANT: Because justify-content and align-items are based on the main and cross axis of your container, their behavior changes when you change the flex-direction of a flex-container.
- gap: new property that performs similar to margin

### landing-page Project
- took a lot longer than expected
- worked on the navbar for a good 90 minutes
- need to perfect my understanding of positioning using flexbox
- many questions about nesting divs (compartmentalization vs simplicity?)

- completed the MVP of the 'hero' section

### cyrusolinger.com
- didn't work on it today
- spent more time than expected on TOP landing-page project
- plan to practice building a navbar tomorrow

### Notes
- installed IMWheel via terminal, mainly copy and pasting but felt cool to solve the scroll wheel issue
